Please find below the examples, on how to find the biases in the model.

Suggestion: The overall percent accuracy of the Logistic model is 76% which is strong.
PPV= true positives \ (true positives + false positives) = 92 / (92+23) =.80
NPV= true negatives\ (true negatives + false negatives) =22/ (22+13)= .63
So after checking the confusion matrix there is bias seen in the model's prediction to Creditworthy.

The accuracy of the Forest model is 79% which is strong
PPV= true positives \ (true positives + false positives) = 102 / (102+28) =.78
NPV= true negatives \ (true negatives + false negatives) = 17/ (17+3) = .85
So after checking the confusion matrix there is no bias seen in the model's prediction.

In order to know whether a model is biased or not, we should look at the accuracies on both segments. You can consider bias as a tendency of a model to predict one of its outcomes much more accurately than the others. Let's say that a model's accuracy in correctly predicting creditworthy individuals is 79% and the accuracy in correctly predicting non-creditworthy individuals is 60%. 
This means that this particular model has bias towards correctly predicting creditworthy individuals because its accuracy in this segment is way higher than in the other. Now another model has about 79% accuracy predicting Creditworthiness and 81% of accuracy in predicting non-creditworthiness. In this case, we say that this model is almost not biased at all, because the difference between those accuracies is very small.

You should use 3 numeric measures to match treatment and control stores.

Trend
Seasonality
AvgMonthSales (This should be determined by looking at the correlation between the appropriate numeric variables in the round roasters stores file AvgMonthSales and Sq_ft with the performance metric gross margin.) 
- This variable is in the round-roaster-stores.csv file

AB Analysis Tool
Make sure to use weekly gross margin per store in all lift calculations and not total sales. Your data has gross margin in it but you will have to use a summarize tool to get weekly gross margin per store.

Steps
Filter the data to the proper date range
*Aggregate the data to get the weekly gross margin and weekly traffic count (count of unique invoices)
Calculate Trend and Seasonality with the AB Trend Tool
Label the data as treatment and control stores
Calculate correlation between other numeric measures and the performance metric (gross margin)
Match Treatment to control stores per region using the AB Controls Tool
Calculate lift from control to treatment store with AB Analysis tool
